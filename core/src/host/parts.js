// Parts: making room in a long conversation (a checkpoint in place, or a switch to a
// fresh Session), the handoff note and package, and earlier pages for the chat view.
//
// A Bot's conversations are long-lived, and the compaction backend's own pressure
// line does not apply to them. Once a turn ends with the context past the check line
// (a share of what the model can take), the context steward (steward.js) reads the
// latest messages and decides. Work still under way: the older messages are condensed
// in place into a checkpoint that keeps the messages to the Bot word for word, and
// the part goes on. Work at a stopping point: the part moves on to a fresh Session,
// and the old one is archived whole. For that the Bot writes a handoff note while
// idle, from the same prefix as its own requests, so the provider serves it from
// cache and nobody waits. A turn that grows past the hard line, near the window, gets
// the same decision before its next step; a context overflow moves on without a note.
// The next part opens with the handoff package: the note, the latest messages word for
// word, and where the rest is. Input that arrives meanwhile waits and moves along.
// read_own_chat searches every part, the condensed messages included.
